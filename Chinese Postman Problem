Algorithm to find shortest closed path or optimal 
Chinese postman route in a weighted graph that may
not be Eulerian.
step 1 : If graph is Eulerian, return sum of all 
         edge weights.Else do following steps.
step 2 : We find all the vertices with odd degree 
step 3 : List all possible pairings of odd vertices  
         For n odd vertices total number of pairings 
         possible are, (n-1) * (n-3) * (n -5)... * 1
step 4 : For each set of pairings, find the shortest 
         path connecting them.
step 5 : Find the pairing with minimum shortest path 
         connecting pairs.
step 6 : Modify the graph by adding all the edges that  
         have been found in step 5.
step 7 : Weight of Chinese Postman Tour is sum of all 
         edges in the modified graph.
step 8 : Print Euler Circuit of the modified graph. 
         This Euler Circuit is Chinese Postman Tour.
